API Changes (Backward-Compatible)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new ``ConnectionTerminated`` event, which fires when GOAWAY frames
  are received.
- Added a subclass of ``NoSuchStreamError``, called ``StreamClosedError``, that
  fires when actions are taken on a stream that is closed and has had its state
  flushed from the system.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Do not throw ``ProtocolError``s when attempting to send multiple GOAWAY
  frames on one connection.
- We no longer forcefully change the decoder table size when settings changes
  are ACKed, instead waiting for remote acknowledgement of the change.
- Improve the performance of checking whether a stream is open.
